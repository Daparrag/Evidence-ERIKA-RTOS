This is the repository of ERIKA Enterprise v3.

##About ERIKA Enterprise

ERIKA Enterprise started as a Ph.D. project more that 16 years ago on a single core 16-bit MCU. Nowadays, 
ERIKA supports more than 15 CPU architectures, 20 compilers, and a number of evaluation boards. 
All this thanks to the great community of companies and University Labs 
(among them, a special role goes to the team of the ReTiS Lab of the Scuola Superiore S. Anna) 
which are using the kernel in real products, University courses, and Research Projects.  
Despite the growth, the internal structure of the kernel (the kernel API as well as the makefiles) 
recalls the structure of the very initial release, which was not thought to support all this variety of hardware platforms and manage the complexity embodied in latest raising platform such as multi-many core .
We received over the years comments and critics on how to manage various issues of the current structure, 
but we never went on on a complete restructuring of the kernel, mainly because of the huge work involved.
